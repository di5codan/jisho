# Grammar
## 1. これ, それ, あれ
これ, それ, あれ, and どれ are a set of こそあど words. You can use them to refer to things you want to talk about, without specifying what they are. In general, これ is used for things that are close to the speaker, それ is used for things that are close to the listener, and あれ is used for things that are close to neither of them. どれ is the question word that accompanies them, and asks "Which one?" out of a choice of three or more objects.
Conceptualizing こそあど

There are nine basic sets of words in Japanese that begin with こ, そ, あ, and ど. They have different meanings and functions depending on the endings that come after こそあど.

However, all these sets share the same concept ー the first syllable of each word in the set indicates the relative distance between you and whatever it is you're referring to. The relative distance from your listener to the thing you're referring to can also come into play.

Here is how こそあど words work when referring to a physical object that you can see:

こ-Words: 
Words that begin with こ are used for things that are either relatively close to the speaker, or closer to the speaker than to the listener.

そ-Words: 
Words that begin with そ are used for things that are further from the speaker and/or are closer to the listener.

あ-Words: 
Words that begin with あ are used for things that are far from the speaker, and also the listener if there is one.

ど-Words: 
Words that begin with ど are used to ask a question.

これ, それ, あれ, and どれ are pronouns that can be used in sentences in the same way as nouns. This means that they can be the subject, object, or indirect object.

### Textbook
When you want to talk about things you do not know the name of, you can use such expressions as kore, sore, are, and dore.  Kore refers to something close to the speaker; sore refers to something close to the person you’re talking to; are refers to an object that is neither close to the speaker or the listener.

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| あれは私のペンです | That is my pen over there |
| これはいくらですか | How much is this? |
| それはさんぜんえんです | That is 3,000 yen |

Dore means can be used to express “which.” Question words like dore and nani cannot be followed by the particle wa. Instead, they must be followed by the particle ga.

| どれがあなたのペンですか | Which one is your pen? |

## 2. この, その, あの
この, その, あの, and どの are a set of こそあど words. They all go before nouns to give information about their location in relation to you. In general, この attaches to something close to the speaker, その to something close to the listener, and あの to something close to neither of them. どの is the question word that asks "which…?" out of a choice of three or more objects.

### Textbook
_Kore, sore, are,_ and _dare_ can be modified by replacing the final _re_ with _no_ to specify an object.  It is important to note that _kono, sono, ano,_ and _dono_ cannot stand alone:  they must be followed by a noun.  For example, if you know that the item in your hand is a watch (_tokee_) you can say:

このとけいはいくらですか。                How much is this watch?  
kono tokee wa ikura desu ka.

As opposed to:

これはいくらですか。                            How much is this?  
kore wa ikura desu ka.

To summarize:  
これ　（は～）        このnoun  （は～）            close to the person speaking  
それ　（は～）　　そのnoun  （は～）            close to the person listening  
あれ　（は～）　　あれnoun  （は～）            far from both people  
どれ　（は～）　　どのnoun  （は～）            unknown

## 3. ここ, そこ, あそこ
ここ, そこ, あそこ, and どこ are a set of こそあど words. They describe places you want to talk about without specifying exactly where they are. In general, ここ refers to places close to the speaker, そこ refers to places close to the listener, or reasonably far from both the speaker and listener if they're side by side, and あそこ refers to places close to neither of them. どこ is the question word that pairs together with these characters, and asks "where?"

### Textbook
koko, soko, asoko, and doko are all words for places.

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| ここ | here, near me |
| そこ | there, near you |
| あそこ | over there |
| どこ | where |

| | |
| --- | --- |
| すみません、ゆうびんきょくはどこですか | Excuse me, where is the post office? |

## 4. だれの noun

The question word for “who” is _dare_, and for “whose” we simply add the particle _no_.

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| これはだれのかばんですか | Whose bag is this?  |
| それはスーさんのかばんです | That is Sue’s bag.   |

## 5. Noun も

### Textbook
Using this formation you can say “Item A is this, and item B is this, too.”

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| たけしさんは日本人です | Takeshi is a Japanese person |
| みちこさんも日本人です | Michiko is Japanses, too |

Mo must directly follow the object to which it is referring.  Mo is the equivalent to the English word “too.”


## 6. じゃない
Adding 〜じゃない or 〜ではない to the end of a noun or a な-adjective makes it negative, similar to the way "not" functions in English.

### Textbook
To negate a statement of the form X wa Y desu, where Y is a noun, you replace desu with ja arimasen.

| --- | --- |
| 山田さんは学生じゃありません | Mr. Yamada is not a student. |

## 7. ～ね / ～よ

### Textbook
Ne is an end particle expressing the speaker’s desire for confirmation from the listener.  An English equivalent might be “right?”

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| メアリーさんのせんもんはぶんがくですね | Mary, your major is literature, right? |
| これはにくじゃありませんね | This is not meat, is it? |

Yo is another end particle that expresses the speaker’s desire to assure the listener of what has been said.  A rough English translation is “I tell you.”  When yo is added, the statement become

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| とんかつはさかなじゃありませんよ | Let me assure you, “tonkatsu” is not fish. |
| スミスさんはイギリスじんですよ | (In case you were wondering,) Mr. Smith is British. |
