## General Context notes
- Formal vs informal: I usually won't say "informal", I'll just omit the "formal" part of it. Since formal usually just comes down to omitting honorifics from the word/verb conjugation. The absence of formality doesn't mean its "informal", it just means its at the baseline version of the language. Culturally not casting a veil of formality implies a level of familiarity with the person, which would make people uncomfortable. Truly informal language is absurdly arrogant, i.e Yakuza, or delinquent teenagers. Also the cocky/boastful bad guys in anime. 

- The leaving/returning phrases are VERY commonly used. You'd never say sayonara when leaving the home since that would feel like you're leaving for an indefinite amount of time. Basically if you live with a family/roomates you're 100% going to hear/use these. And if you're not 100% sure someone is home or not you'll yell it into the empty house regardless.

- The before/after meal phrases are also pretty common, probably ~50% of meals you'll say either one. Basically its a vibe whether you should say it or not (adds a sprinkle of excitement/formality/satisfaction to the meal)

- Formal leaving/returning phrases: I almost never see these used formally, but there's probably some families that do. From my perspective this would be some tiger parent ultra discipline style families.

- は: Yeah its normally pronounced "ha", but if its being used as a subject particle/at the end of a word, you pronounce it as "wa". Deal with it 

- Where's the Kanji in this section?  Most/all of these phrases originally had at least 1 kanji root word inside of them. But in general there's a trend that the more commonly/frequently a word is used, the more likely it is the kanji usage will fall out of favor. Since these are some of the most common Japanese phrases you'll see, barely any Kanji. Once you learn more kanji/readings you'll start to recognize the missing Kanji.
