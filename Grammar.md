A clause is a group of words working together that contains both a subject and a verb. Clauses can be independent or dependent. An independent clause can stand on its own as a complete sentence. Words like "as" "from" "because" preceeding a clause are common of examples of what would make a clause dependant. Thus an independant clause can be thought of as a complete thought.

Predicate
Grammatical term for the words in a sentence that describe the action. A majority of the time this is based on a verb + conjucation. Along with the subject, the predicate is one of two necessary parts that make a complete sentence.

Each of these end in a character on the う-line of the hiragana chart when they are in the plain/dictionary form, which explains why they're often called "う-verbs" in textbooks

As these verbs conjugate, the う-line character will shift through the five vowel sounds in the hiragana chart (あ, い, う, え, お). This is where they get the name 五段ごだん (five-level) verbs.

Let's check this out with one of our example verbs, 聞く (to listen):

|                     |                |          |              |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Hiragana Chart Line | Tense          | Japanese | English      |
