# Code Stuff
make a copy/paste regex program to copy based on certain paramaters based on a list. Also undo functionality, i.e keep history of copy/paste/params/undo to be able to undo/track usage statistics. Therefore also record a list of number of matching results (and maybe each time create a file that has a query of all the results, i.e  dont re create file when do vs undo)

Create a markdown anki python script that uses markdown (figure out some universal file/tag/folder schemas) that generates anki decks. 
TODO: study how that one anki script does it, since it seems to auto propagate information 

Write a python script to automatically find + generate + append pitch patterns. TODO find the old schema (and maybe code?) It was a thing had both code to do it and a website. May have a link to the site, whcih came from a repo
