# 氏
It's Otaku speech.

A very polite and general suffix that is often used in formal writing and very often heard on the news. The stereotypical otaku will refer to their otaku-comrades with ~氏.

It's supposed to show awkwardness in their speech when they use 氏 instead of the common さん. It's overly formal and polite for casual speech like someone who constantly addresses everyone as sir or madam even to those in their similar age group.

He makes Amasawa uncomfortable addressing her Joshi.

Joshi(女史)

This is used to woman with high social status. Originally this used to be honorific title for women substitute for “Shi(氏). Some women treated equally to men are only ones who have high social status.” This is recognized as very old honorific title now so we rarely use this in both every day conversation and business scene. In some cases, this contains a sarcastic nuance.
