My 日本語ノート, written in Markdown.
Mostly based on Genki + Tobira

These are very disorganized notes at the moment. Will cleanup when possible.

Need to update this readme and add an index (multiple). 
Also tons of general cleanup + automated python generation.

Next big planned feature is pitch accent diagrams in vocabulary files. Will require python script + svg color settings that will render in light/dark mode 

Best read with Obsidian.md (in dark mode)

Kanji stroke order based on 
https://github.com/cayennes/kanji-colorize

Kanji radical notes based on kanjidamage + takoboto + Jisho.org. 
Don't agree with kanjidamages language/phrases, but love their relational links layout on their site based on radicals. Started using it in highschool, haven't been able to transition over to Wani Kani.
Apologies if any carry over risque phrasing still present in my notes
