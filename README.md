# jisho

My 日本語ノート, written in Markdown.
Mostly based on Genki + 

Need to update this readme and add an index. 
Also tons of general cleanup + automated python generation.

Best read with Obsidian.md

Kanji stroke order based on 
https://github.com/cayennes/kanji-colorize

Kanji radical notes based on kanjidamage + takoboto + Jisho.org. 
Don't agree with kanjidamages language/phrases, but love their relational links layout on their site based on radicals. Started using it in highschool, haven't been able to transition over to Wani Kani
Apologies if any carry over risque phrasing still present in my notes.
