Crunchyroll started as a site to pirate anime, seems like it got enough traffic that it made more sense for them to just be legit.

Funimation seemed to have started as the primary/only means for the anime industry to distribute anime legally/paid to the rest of the world. Lots of users in Southeast Asia. Besides offering a catalog of streamable anime to subscribers, it was very popular to purchase digital/downloadable BluRay editions of anime. 

2x problems. 

1. Funimation user specific. 
Although Crunchyroll is offering an ability to transfer digital ownership, people are pretty confident the things they paid extra for to download indefinitely won't all/at all transfer since Crunchyrolls site doesn't have the same features to access content like this, especially since it requires an extra payment tier to download stuff. 

For Crunchyroll+ Funimation users, huge issue is to accommodate all the merged users + licenses + traffic, all users will need to start paying double the price they had to originally.

Japan isn't helping at all since they don't use either Crunchyroll or Funimation, or really any mainstream anime streaming services. Culturally they're very content with the "if you have cable you can just record any anime you want since it's showing all the new anime constantly, and the classics are always doing replays". Plus, although it's expensive, it's kind of a badge of honor to buy the physical media of amine you really really like. So until theirs a market for it they're not going to touch the Crunchyroll monopoly.


TODO: look into timeline/logistics of them partnering with the anime industry.
